# catalyst-cucumber-tests

Repo for Catalyst's cucumber tests. Intended to be deployed into the "features" directory of a project that will need to run them (e.g. [catalyst-ansible](https://github.com/dheles/catalyst-ansible) - the ansible project responsible for installing Catalyst).

## NOTE:
the gemfile and lock file are (currently) managed here, but they are to be deployed *outside* the features directory. further elaboration of this system may involve moving them elsewhere.
